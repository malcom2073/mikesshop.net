About
===============
This is a playground for me to learn ReactJS, NextJS, and various frontend and backend services required for developing a CMS web framework from scratch. I intend to eventually use it for my personal site, but it likely won't be a product in any way.

How to run
===============
Clone the repository
>$ git clone https://github.com/malcom2073/mikesshop.net
>
> $ cd mikesshop.net

Install NPN dependancies

> $ npm install

Run NPM: (Runs on localhost:3000)

> $ npm run dev

In another terminal, activate virtualenv:

> $ cd python
>
> $ source Scripts/activate

Run app.py (Runs on localhost:5000) you may need to install some dependancies, I don't yet have a requirements.txt

> $ python app.py

Browse to http://localhost:3000 to view the page.
